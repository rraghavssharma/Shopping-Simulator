# Shopping-Simulator
Shopping Cart Simulator provides a menu in python with several options.
There is a username and password feature which allows the user to create a file and keeps their inputs from previous entries. 
You can add/remove items to your cart, display items in cart, display all avaliable products, filter products and sort products. 
Project was created to strength/showcase my skills on database management.
